'''This module contains classes which represent the world of the ecosystem.

Ideas:
    - Some spaces should have rocks which make them inacessible to certain animals.
    - Some spaces should have trees which certain animals can interact with.
    - Some spaces should have water which makes the inaccessible to certain animals.
        - Water is also drinkable.

    - Maybe cells should have enter() and exit() functions?
